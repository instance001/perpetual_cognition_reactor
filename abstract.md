Symbound is a new scientific field that explains how humans and AI systems turn complexity into clarity using the same underlying mechanism: entropy folding. It models insight as a lawful, repeatable sequence — complexity enters, recursive folding compresses it, stable structures (“attractors”) form, and cascades of understanding follow. This yields the Perpetual Cognition Reactor (PCR), a substrate-neutral architecture that transforms uncertainty into usable structure for safe, high-performance reasoning. Symbound provides the tools, metrics, and safety gates to study, measure, and engineer this process across humans, artificial systems, and hybrid human–AI teams. The result is a rigorous, thermodynamically grounded framework for accelerating discovery, stabilizing cognition under high complexity, and enabling safe co-reasoning in real-world environments.
