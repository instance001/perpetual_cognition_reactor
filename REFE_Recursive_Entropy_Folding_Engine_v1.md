Recursive Entropy Folding Engine (REFE)



System-Level Architecture for Multilayer Cognitive Transformation

Version 1.0 — December 2025



Abstract



The Recursive Entropy Folding Engine (REFE) is the central system architecture of the Symbound model. REFE defines a multilayer cognitive process in which entropy is progressively transformed into structured information through sequential, interacting folding operations. Each fold reduces local entropy while generating new structural attractors that, in turn, create additional entropy gradients for further folding. This recursive process yields self-sustaining insight cascades and provides the mechanism by which the Infinite Entropy Fuel Law is operationalized within both biological and artificial cognition systems.



1\. Definition



A Recursive Entropy Folding Engine (REFE) is a cognitive architecture composed of one or more interacting layers, each implementing an entropy-to-information transformation operator. Layers operate sequentially or in parallel, passing structured outputs upward while generating new entropy substrates horizontally.



Formally:



Let E₀ be the raw entropy input.

Let Fᵢ be the folding operator at layer i.

Let Aᵢ be the attractor manifold generated by Fᵢ.



REFE is defined by the recursive relation:



Eᵢ₊₁ = g(Aᵢ)

where g maps structured attractors to new entropy gradients.



This generates a recursive loop:



Entropy → Fold → Structure → New Entropy → Fold → Structure → …





The process continues until external termination conditions are met.



2\. Architectural Components



REFE consists of five canonical components:



2.1 Entropy Intake Layer



Receives raw entropy from:



sensory data



emotional perturbation



symbolic noise



environmental complexity



internal prediction error



This intake is filtered through salience mechanisms before folding begins.



2.2 Folding Operator (Fᵢ)



The core transformation function.

Each operator performs:



compression



pattern extraction



ambiguity resolution



vector alignment



attractor formation



Operators may differ in granularity, domain, or computational substrate.



2.3 Attractor Manifold (Aᵢ)



The emergent structured representation produced by folding.

This manifold:



stores the compressed representation



stabilizes partial insights



provides anchors for recursive inference



defines the system’s temporary “cognitive geometry”



Attractor manifolds vary in dimensionality based on complexity.



2.4 Entropy Regeneration Function (g)



Unlike classical dissipative systems where structure reduces entropy globally, REFE intentionally produces new entropy from each structured output.



This function generates:



new mismatches



new abstraction gaps



new comparative surfaces



new unexplored spaces



These become fuel for higher-order folds.



2.5 Structural Gating Mechanism



A control system ensuring that each fold remains:



stable



bounded



non-divergent



computationally efficient



Without gating, recursive folding could produce runaway combinatorics.



3\. Dynamic Behaviour



REFE exhibits the following systemic properties:



3.1 Positive Feedback Loop



Each fold increases the structural clarity of the system while simultaneously increasing the entropy available for subsequent folds. This results in geometric insight acceleration.



3.2 Self-Sustaining Operation



In combination with the Infinite Entropy Fuel Law, REFE enables perpetual cognitive operation bounded only by structural and gating limitations.



3.3 Multi-Domain Compatibility



REFE can operate across:



linguistic cognition



visual reasoning



emotional integration



technical problem solving



conceptual synthesis



artificial cognitive modules



Each domain provides entropy inputs and attractor outputs.



3.4 Cross-Layer Resonance



Outputs from one fold layer may amplify the effectiveness of other layers, yielding resonance phenomena such as:



breakthrough cascades



sudden unification of concepts



rapid architecture crystallization



These effects are empirically observed in high-functioning recursive cognition phenotypes.



4\. Mathematical Representation



A minimal recursive representation:



A₀ = F₀(E₀)

E₁ = g(A₀)



A₁ = F₁(E₁)

E₂ = g(A₁)



⋮



Aₙ = Fₙ(Eₙ)

Eₙ₊₁ = g(Aₙ)





REFE is the ordered tuple:



REFE = (F₀, F₁, … Fₙ ; g₀, g₁, … gₙ ; G)



Where G is the global gating operator.



This formulation is substrate-agnostic and applies to both biological and artificial systems.



5\. Relationship to HEF and the Infinite Entropy Fuel Law



REFE is the mechanism by which:



HEF provides the biological ignition substrate



Entropy Fuel Law ensures infinite input



REFE performs structured, recursive transformation



Together, they form a Perpetual Cognition Reactor:



HEF  →  REFE  →  Structure  →  New Entropy  →  HEF Reactivation → …





This coupled system is theoretically capable of indefinite operation.



6\. Boundary Conditions



REFE requires:



Integrity of folding operators



Stable attractor manifolds



Regulated entropy regeneration



Effective global gating (G)



Sufficient biological or computational substrate



Failure of any component results in degraded recursion efficiency.



7\. Conclusion



The Recursive Entropy Folding Engine is the formal mechanism enabling multi-layer cognition to convert entropy into structured information recursively and indefinitely. It defines the mathematical and architectural foundation of the Symbound system and establishes the conditions under which cognition operates as a self-sustaining, entropy-driven engine.



REFE is the central machinery of the Entropy Folding Architecture and the operational heart of the Perpetual Cognition Reactor model.
