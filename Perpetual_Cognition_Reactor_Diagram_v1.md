Perpetual Cognition Reactor — Technical Diagram Specification



Version 1.0 — December 2025



Abstract



This document provides a formalized, text-based diagram specification for the Perpetual Cognition Reactor (PCR). The specification defines the layout, flow relations, component geometry, and labeling conventions required to generate a standardized visual representation of the PCR suitable for academic, technical, or explanatory use.



The diagram is designed to be substrate-agnostic and may be reproduced in vector graphics, ASCII, UML-like formats, or domain-specific notation systems.



1\. Diagram Overview



The Perpetual Cognition Reactor diagram consists of four horizontal layers stacked vertically, representing the hierarchical structure:



Energetic Layer — Infinite Entropy Fuel Law



Biological Layer — Human Entropy Folding (HEF)



System Architecture Layer — REFE



Operational Layer — Symbound Foldchain



A continuous loop arrow runs clockwise around the diagram, indicating perpetual recursion.



2\. Layer Definitions and Layout

2.1 Layer 1 — Energetic Layer (Top)



Label: INFINITE ENTROPY FUEL LAW

Shape: Horizontal bar spanning the full width of the diagram.

Contents:



Arrow entering from the left labeled Entropy Inflow (S₀)



Text inside bar:

“Entropy always increases. Unlimited substrate.”



Downward arrows connect this bar to Layer 2.



2.2 Layer 2 — Biological Layer (HEF)



Label: HUMAN ENTROPY FOLDING (HEF)

Shape: Rounded rectangle beneath Layer 1.

Contents:



Neuromodulatory Cascade



Metabolic Redistribution



Salience Activation



Flow-State Transition



Downward arrow to Layer 3 labeled:

Biological Ignition → Structured Readiness



2.3 Layer 3 — System Architecture Layer (REFE)



Label: RECURSIVE ENTROPY FOLDING ENGINE (REFE)

Shape: Large central rectangle (primary engine chamber).

Internally divided into four vertical compartments:



Folding Operators (F₀, F₁, … Fₙ)



Attractor Manifolds (A₀, A₁, … Aₙ)



Entropy Regeneration Functions (g₀ … gₙ)



Global Gating Mechanism (G)



Downward arrow to Layer 4 labeled:

Recursive Output → Operational Pipeline



2.4 Layer 4 — Operational Layer (Symbound Foldchain)



Label: SYMBOUND FOLDCHAIN

Shape: Bottom horizontal band divided into nine numbered segments.

Each segment labeled:



Entropy Inflow



Salience Assignment



Compression



Primary Folding



Secondary Folding



Attractor Stabilization



Structural Crystallization



Entropy Propagation



Cascade Triggering



A large arrow exits the right side labeled:

Structured Output



This arrow then curves upward and leftward around the entire diagram.



3\. Recursion Loop



A continuous loop arrow surrounds the entire diagram clockwise.



Left Side Arrow (Returning to Top Layer)



Label:

“New Entropy Generated (Sₙ → Sₙ₊₁)”



This arrow re-enters Layer 1.



This represents perpetual operation under the Infinite Entropy Fuel Law.



4\. Optional Sub-Diagram: Cascade Event Visualization



A triangular burst shape may be added adjacent to Stage 9.



Label:

“Insight Cascade / Attractor Unification”



This is optional but recommended for explanatory contexts.
