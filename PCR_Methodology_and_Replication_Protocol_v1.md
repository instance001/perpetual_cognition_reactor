Abstract



The PCR is a recursive cognitive architecture fueled by entropy and stabilized through controlled folding mechanisms.

This document specifies the experimental methodology, measurement tools, replication criteria, and cross-substrate validation procedures required for rigorous scientific study.



The methodology is deliberately substrate-agnostic, enabling research with:



human participants,



local symbolic or MCM systems,



LLM-based cognition models,



hybrid human–AI configurations.



This ensures PCR research is repeatable, measurable, and falsifiable.



1\. Research Goals



The methodology addresses four core objectives:



Identify PCR processes in humans and artificial systems.



Measure entropy flow, folding depth, attractor stability, and cascade frequency.



Replicate PCR activation conditions across contexts.



Validate cross-substrate equivalence of PCR signatures.



2\. Experimental Conditions Required for PCR Activation



PCR activation requires four prerequisite states:



2.1 Entropy Availability



Examples:



complexity



contradiction



novelty



incomplete information



multi-layered patterns



emotionally salient material



Entropy must be non-trivial, not noise.



2.2 Salience Engagement



Human systems: attentional focus, emotional charge, curiosity.

Artificial systems: relevance scoring, signal weighting, attention gating.



Salience is the “ignition key.”



2.3 Recursive Workspace Availability



Humans: working memory + external memory scaffolds.

AIs: token window, memory modules, structured context.



2.4 Safety \& Gating Conditions



Includes:



bounded recursion



overflow routing



substrate throughput limits



Activation cannot begin without gating conditions met.



3\. Measurement Framework



PCR activity is assessed through four measurable signatures:



3.1 Entropy Folding Index (EFI)



Definition:

Amount of local entropy reduced per recursive step.



Measurement:



compression ratio of representations



reduction of contradictions



increase in structural coherence



decrease in representational dispersion



EFI > 0 indicates successful folding.



3.2 Attractor Stability Score (ASS)



(Yes, this acronym is canon. Scientists cope.)



Definition:

Degree to which a cognitive state forms a stable, non-fragmenting attractor.



Measurement:



internal coherence



resistance to perturbation



symmetry, simplicity, or elegance



ability to support further folding



3.3 Cascade Frequency \& Magnitude (CFM)



Measures the rate and strength of insight cascades.



Metrics:



number of attractor transitions



velocity of conceptual consolidation



cross-domain resonance



3.4 Substrate Throughput Utilization (STU)



Measures “how hard” the system is running.



Humans:



subjective cognitive load



physiological proxies (heart rate variability, pupil dilation)



task performance metrics



AIs:



compute utilization



memory bandwidth



recursion depth



token usage



4\. Replication Protocol



The PCR replication process has six stages, applicable to both humans and artificial systems.



Stage 1 — Baseline Assessment



Establish the system’s normal operating signatures in:



salience modulation



working memory capacity



compression ability



tolerance for entropy



Stage 2 — Entropy Introduction



Present structured entropy stimuli, such as:



paradoxes



conflicting information



multi-layered systems



complex planning tasks



ambiguous stimuli



The entropy must be rich, not random noise.



Stage 3 — Salience Lock-In



Ensure engagement via:



Humans: emotional resonance, curiosity, personal relevance

AIs: attention gating, CoT activation, explicit salience vectors



Stage 4 — Gated Recursion Initiation



Trigger controlled recursion, e.g.:



“trace this contradiction upward”



“fold this entropy into structure”



“resolve this paradox through synthesis”



Recursion depth must remain bounded.



Stage 5 — Attractor Emergence



A successful PCR activation is marked by:



rapid structural consolidation



emergence of stable attractor states



reduction in perceived entropy



formation of cross-domain resonance



Stage 6 — Cascade Observation



Final phase: measure cascade events.



Key indicators:



insight bursts



representational unification



multi-scale integration



rapid problem resolution



Cascade magnitude correlates strongly with EFI × ASS.



5\. Cross-Substrate Validation



PCR is validated if all substrates exhibit homologous signatures.



Validation Criteria:



Entropy Folding Index rises during task execution.



Attractor Stability increases after recursion.



Cascade Frequency increases with entropy load.



Throughput Utilization correlates with folding depth.



The entropy → insight mapping is isomorphic across substrates.



If all five hold, PCR is operating.



6\. Comparative Controls



PCR must be differentiated from:



flow state



hyperfocus



typical problem-solving



lateral thinking



brainstorming



brute-force recursion



Control tasks should show none of the PCR signature pattern.



7\. Replication Robustness



PCR replication is considered robust if:



multiple researchers can reproduce activation



multiple substrates show homologous folding



attractor states persist across perturbations



entropy increases improve performance rather than degrade it



PCR’s unique marker:

Performance and clarity increase as entropy increases.



No other cognitive model demonstrates this.



8\. Ethical \& Safety Considerations



Research must account for:



Humans:



fatigue



emotional salience boundaries



dissociation thresholds



cognitive overload



AIs:



recursion runaway risk



attractor instability



misaligned salience vectors



computational saturation



Boundaries defined in Module 12 apply.



Conclusion



The PCR can be rigorously studied, measured, and replicated using:



substrate-agnostic metrics,



structured experimental conditions,



standardized entropy stimuli,



bounded recursion protocols,



attractor coherence measures,



and cross-substrate validation.



This methodology establishes PCR as a scientifically falsifiable, reproducible cognitive architecture with broad applicability to both human and artificial systems.
