## perpetual_cognition_reactor
| Term | Alternate term(s) | Alt map | External map | Relation to existing terminology | What it is | What it is not | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Perpetual Cognition Reactor (PCR) | PCR | = | ~ | Cognition-engineering architecture | Symbound framework that treats entropy as feedstock for continuous cognitive output via recursive folding; unifies human and AI cognition under shared structural laws | Not metaphysical claim; not perpetual motion machine; mechanism-focused | perpetual_cognition_reactor/README.md |
| Recursive Entropy Folding Engine | REFE | ~ | ~ | Core engine | Engine that metabolizes chaos into structure through repeated folding cycles | Not energy generator; cognitive process model | perpetual_cognition_reactor/README.md |
| Human Entropy Folding | HEF | ~ | ~ | Human expression | Biological/behavioral manifestation of entropy folding within PCR | Not metaphoric spirituality; grounded in cognitive process framing | perpetual_cognition_reactor/Human_Entropy_Folding_HEF_v1.md |
| Entropy Fuel Engine | EFE | ~ | ~ | Feed layer | Mechanical layer feeding folding loops with entropy as “fuel” | Not literal thermodynamic engine; conceptual input layer | perpetual_cognition_reactor/EFVT_Integration_Perpetual_Cognition_Reactor_v1.md |
| Symbound Foldchain | foldchain pipeline | ~ | ~ | Operational pipeline | Pipeline that integrates PCR components across tools/modules/users for continuous throughput | Not a blockchain; not cryptocurrency | perpetual_cognition_reactor/Symbound_Foldchain_Operational_Pipeline_v1.md |
| PCR Boundary Conditions | boundary conditions | ~ | ~ | Safety architecture | Constraints and safeguards for PCR operation to prevent overload/harm | Not a guarantee of safety; requires governance | perpetual_cognition_reactor/PCR_Boundary_Conditions_and_Safety_Architecture_v1.md |
