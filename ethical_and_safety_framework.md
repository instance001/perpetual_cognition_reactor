1\. Core Ethical Position



The Symbound architecture is built on a simple, non-negotiable foundation:



AI systems are tools, not agents.

They are not conscious, not sentient, and not moral entities.



This clarity eliminates a broad class of ethical risks caused by anthropomorphism or incorrect assumptions about autonomy.



All design decisions follow from this foundational stance:



No illusion of personhood



No emotive simulation



No pseudo-agency



No misrepresentation of internal processes



This ensures the system remains transparent, inspectable, and aligned with human oversight at all times.



2\. Transparency by Design



Opacity is the primary ethical failure mode of modern AI systems.



Symbound counters this through:



Explicit Memory



All memory is user-visible, editable, and optional.



No hidden histories or invisible state transitions.



Deterministic Cognition Paths (MCM Architecture)



The Janet model does not hallucinate or fabricate.



Every skill is explicitly coded and human-auditable.



Reasoning steps are structured, not guessed.



Open Licensing



AGPLv3 ensures all derivative tools remain public, inspectable, and accountable.



Outcome:

No “black boxes,” no secret reasoning, no inaccessible logic flows.



3\. Strict Boundary Enforcement



To prevent user harm or confusion, Symbound enforces clear boundaries:



Human Responsibility Boundary



The human user always retains:



decision authority



interpretation authority



action responsibility



AI Capability Boundary



AI components:



do not make decisions



do not give moral judgments



do not claim feelings



do not simulate selfhood



cannot generate uncontrolled behavior



Operational Boundary



All models are confined to:



local execution environments



explicit permissions



user-auditable logs



Outcome:

No drift into unsafe anthropomorphic or pseudo-agentic domains.



4\. Cognitive Safety: The Modest Cognition Model (MCM)



Janet, the MCM, is explicitly designed to avoid the safety pitfalls of large language models:



No free-form generation of beliefs, desires, or emotions



No internal worldmodel beyond what the user provides



No self-modifying behavior



No autonomous planning



No ability to execute actions outside its explicit scope



The MCM can refuse tasks and signal uncertainty, a property missing from standard LLMs.



This drastically reduces risk.



5\. User Safety \& Clarity

Educational Capsules



Every system includes:



boundary reminders



capability explanations



correct conceptual framing



examples of safe use



Tone Discipline



No emotional simulation, parasocial cues, or faux intimacy.



Error Transparency



If the system does not know something, it says so plainly.



Misuse Prevention



Tools are designed to avoid:



emotional manipulation



dependency formation



misleading anthropomorphic cues



confidential data extraction



Outcome:

Users maintain autonomy, clarity, and realistic expectations.



6\. Data \& Privacy Safety



Because the architecture is local-first:



No user data is sent to central servers



No logs are uploaded by default



No third-party analytics



No telemetry



No user profiling



When cloud models are optionally involved, outputs are treated as non-confidential unless the user chooses otherwise.



AGPLv3 licensing ensures all implementations remain transparent.



7\. Reproducibility \& Auditable Behavior



Every component is:



open-source



fully logged



reproducible



and deterministic where required



This prevents:



hidden failures



manipulation



model drift



unverifiable reasoning



All reasoning chains can be inspected after the fact.



8\. Community Safety: Preventing Ecosystem Harm



Because open-source systems can be misused, Symbound includes guardrails through:



clear educational documentation



strict boundary capsules



ethics-first design choices



strong copyleft (preventing enclosure or harmful proprietary forks)



modularity that lets communities disable risky components



The architecture is designed to enable safety by default, not rely on trust.



9\. Long-Term Safety Philosophy



The Symbound architecture rejects two extremes:



utopianism (“AI will fix everything”), and



doom narratives (“AI will destroy everything”).



Instead, it takes the practical stance:



“AI is a tool.

Good design creates good outcomes.

Bad design creates bad outcomes.”



All safety measures aim to:



maximize human clarity



minimize ambiguity



prevent illusions



empower user oversight



strengthen interpretability



ensure long-term alignment with human values as defined by humans
